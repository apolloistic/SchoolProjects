        <p> The movie <span class="generic">Forrest Gump follows the life events of a man who shares the name as the title of the film. <strong>Gump</strong> faces many tribulations throughout his life, but he never lets any of them interfere with his happiness. From wearing braces on his legs, to having a below average IQ and even being shot, <strong>Gump</strong> continues to believe that good things will happen and goes after his dreams. While several less than ideal things occur during <strong>Gump's</strong> life, he manages to turn each setback into something good for him, such as when he finally gets his braces off he discovers that he is capable of running faster than most other people.</span> This skill allows <strong>Gump</strong> to not only escape his bullies while he is a child in Greenbow, but also to gain a football scholarship, save many soldiers' lives and become famous for his ability. While <strong>Gump</strong> eventually achieves the majority of the things he hoped to throughout the movie, it proved a much more difficult task to win the heart of his life-long friend Jenny Curran. The movie is centered on <strong>Forrest Gump</strong> and the incidences that occur during his life, but during each period in his lifetime he thinks back of Jenny and how important she is to him. Although the two characters grew up together and shared a very close friendship, as the movie progresses they grow apart. This upsets Gump who cares immensely for the girl who had a rough start in life, and it seems the two always end up back in each other's lives, often in extraordinary ways like meeting in the Reflection Pond in D.C. Even though <strong>Gump</strong> is the main character of the film, it similarly tells the story of Curran and the hardships she faces.</p>
